      <hr/>
      <p>                    As a Florida native who now calls North Carolina home, 
                    I was swimming in the ocean when I learned to walk. 
                    As the years passed I spent most days helping my grandpa on the farm and entertaining my younger siblings 
                    as we worked at our parents restaurant. 
                    As an adult I have spent most of my career in the medical field, 
                    but have recently become very interested in coding. I have always enjoyed 
                    conquering challenges and learning new things, which leads me to be interested 
                    in a variety of hobbies. Whether it be raising livestock animals, working as a nurse, 
                    reading, writing, botany, or the newly added art of coding, I love to keep learning 
                    and building new skills. If we were to meet in person, you may 
                    recognize me by noticing my stunning blue eyed gaze which won me best eyes in high school,
                     or by my sarcastic sense of humor that sometimes lands me in trouble... 
                     especially with my fianc√©.
                     </p>
